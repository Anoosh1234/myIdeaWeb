        <span>HTML (Skeleton):</span>

        <p><span>Description:</span> HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the fundamental markup language used in web development. 
        It provides the structural framework for a webpage by defining the elements and their organization. 
        HTML elements include headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more.<br><br>
        <span>Role:</span>Just as the skeleton of a human body supports and positions various body parts, HTML structures and organizes the content of a webpage. 
        It outlines where different elements are located and how they relate to one another.</p>

        <span>CSS (Skin and Muscles):</span>

        <p><span>Description:</span> CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is responsible for the presentation and styling of web content. 
            It controls the visual aspects of a webpage, such as colors, fonts, layout, spacing, and animations.<BR><br>
        <span>Role:</span> CSS acts as the skin and muscles of a webpage. It wraps the HTML structure, making it visually appealing and user-friendly. 
        Just as skin gives the body its appearance, CSS gives the webpage its design and aesthetics.</p>

   <div class="main3">
    <section class="html" id="JavaScript">
        <span>JavaScript (The Brain):</span>

<p><span>Description:</span>JavaScript is a versatile programming language used in web development to create interactivity, perform calculations, and manipulate web page elements.
     It can respond to user actions, fetch data from servers, and dynamically update the page without requiring a full page reload.<br><br>
<span>Role: </span>JavaScript is the brain of the webpage. Like the human brain controls thoughts, actions, and responses, JavaScript controls the behavior and functionality of a webpage. It enables features such as form validation, real-time updates, and interactive elements. It processes user input and can make decisions, making the webpage more intelligent and responsive.</p>
